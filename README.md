#Markdown Editor

####This Readme file was created using the [gh-pages DEMO](http://juliusakula.github.io/editor/#/) of [NG-MD-Editor](https://github.com/juliusakula/editor/).

> This allows you to view your rendered Markdown as you type it. No longer do you have to push your readme file to github to see what the rendered text looks like. You can write all your documentation with this tool, and copy and paste to your README.md files.

<b>Raw HTML and inlined CSS will render, too</b>
<style>b { text-decoration: underline; color: navy; border: 2px dashed; padding: 50px 0; display: block; text-align: center}</style>

```javascript
var text = "All Markdown features are supported";
console.log(text);
```
